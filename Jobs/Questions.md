# Questions
When in an interview there are lots of things to make sure  company will suport you with the things you want to achieve. These questions should help you identify what companies will be more suitable for those goals.

I want to thank Amy Newton for the wonderful questions and thought process about them. a lot of the content you seel below came from a wonderful talk she did.

## Work Hours
### Do they have flexible working hours
This should cover the main procedures for flexible working but as with a lot of questions the important thing is to dive into the answer a little:

### Does the team have people taking advantage of flexible working?
It is important to ask specifically about the team you will be working in because some companies will have flexible working but the team may view a single outlier working flexibly as being diffacult.

## Development
### Do they have provisions for Self Development?
This could be in the form of dedicated training available or a per-person fund. This can vary 

### Last time someone used Self Development provisions
As with flexible working hours, if not everyone has self development provisions or doesnt use them it may be viewed badly when you do.

## Culture
### How does the team work together?
Does the team have a colloborative approach to work through paring and TDD or more through individuals working and contributing on their own? 

### Manager management style?
Its always useful to know how your managers style will affect your day to day working environment.


## Social
### What team events are there?
### Last Team event
### Type of events?
