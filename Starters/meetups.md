# Meetup Groups

The North West Tech Community uses www.meetup.com to arrange and facilitate the regular sessions.

Creating an account is a simple online process and there is also a mobile version for iOS and Android available with reminders to ensure you don't miss them!

All of the Meetup groups are free and they'll all provide food and drinks on the night.

They are a fantastic way to network with likeminded individuals who'll happily share their experiences with you.

The Meetup communities are all active on the Meetup space so this page isn't designed to replace dynamic content, it's simply a basic introduction to some of the key groups to get you started.
