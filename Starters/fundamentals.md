# Solid Fundamentals

Because of the way that technology is it can be very hard to recommend skills and tools that can be the "basics" for everything. Some of these skills will depend on exactly what you eant to do, be it developer, tester or product owner just to name a few.

* Self Awareness
* Self Improvement
* Willing to Learn
